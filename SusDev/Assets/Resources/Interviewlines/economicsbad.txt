As a small business owner, I am struggling on the verge of bankruptcy. Residents in Shapetopia aren’t willing to purchase. 
After I graduated from college, I’ve been sitting at home looking for jobs for like five months. Can you believe that there are over 400 people competing for an entry level position at the same time?
Guess what is the most constant thing in the world? Not gold, not diamond but my salary. It has been lying on the floor for like 10 years. I can hardly afford the family expenses this year. Maybe next year I need to sell my house to pay for my kids’ tuition.
My son is moving out from Shapetopia to seek job opportunities like many other young people.
