I feel like it’s easier to find a doctor this year.
In past years, when I felt sick, I just bought some tablets from the pharmacy because I know I can’t rely on public hospitals with their unmanageable patient load. However, this year I felt like public hospitals became a solution. They became accessible.
It’s really nice to see the treatments offered by public hospitals are improving significantly. You know I can’t afford private hospital treatments.
I feel like my family and I became healthier this year. Thanks to significant improvements in  the environment, I can finally pick up the habit of jogging.
