I feel like our neighborhood became safer this year. I havenâ€™t heard of any burglary happening in our neighborhood. You know they used to happen once or twice a month.
Well I found there were less unemployed folks wandering the streets this year.
I feel our city is becoming more empathetic towards disadvantaged people by offering them more opportunities. 
I feel our city pays increasingly more attention to equity by providing everyone with equal opportunity. I really appreciate that.
