Our family owns a small restaurant. Selling some homemade pizza, beverages you know. For the past few years, we were always struggling on the verge of bankruptcy. This year is a huge triumph! I’ve never seen so many customers! 
As a new graduate, the job search process was exceptionally smooth. According to my seniors, it shouldn’t be that easy. Normally, it should be hundreds of fresh graduates competing for one position. Well, maybe it’s a sign of economics taking off.
Well, believe it or not, my salary got raised for the first time in five years. This is just beyond imagination. My manager told me that our company earned unprecedented profits this year. I couldn't believe my ears!
I am a local personal computer retailer. This year family demand for PCs soared. This doesn’t happen normally. Usually families spend most of their income on food and their debts.
