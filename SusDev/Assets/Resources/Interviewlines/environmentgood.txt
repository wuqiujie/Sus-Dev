It’s really nice to see the river getting clear again. I hope I can go fishing with my grandpa in the near future.
I feel like the air quality has improved significantly in the past year. Recently, I started jogging again. You know, it’s impossible to jog in the past years.
I found a squirrel in my backyards this morning! Holy moly! I haven’t seen a single squirrel for years! God knows how much I missed these lovely little creatures!
I am overjoyed to see our city’s mother river become clear and beautiful again. You know, in the past years it stinks and is covered with garbage.
