I hope our government can control the pollution of our city’s mother river. My father told me when he was a kid, he always went fishing with my grandpa on weekends.
Well, I believe air pollution is a huge issue now. This winter when it snowed, I found some snowflakes were not white but dark gray, covered by carbon pollutants.
I really hope our city’s environment could be better. Ten years ago, every morning I was woken up by birds singing. God I missed those birds.
The sky has been gray most of the days. I really wish to stare at the beautiful blue sky in my backyard with a bottle of iced beer in my hand after getting back from work.
