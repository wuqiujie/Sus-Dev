I hope our government could pay more attention to the safety issues in our neighborhood. There are unemployed people wandering the streets. Everytime, I walk home alone I feel like I'm being stalked.
I hope our city could be more empathetic towards disadvantaged people by offering them more opportunities. People don’t deserve to be underdogs for their entire lives just because they have bad luck.
I hope our government can improve our public transportation system. I can’t afford a car shouldn’t mean that I am deprived to make a living.
Gosh I really hope our government will bridge the gap between private and public education. The Current system makes me feel like decent jobs are exclusive to private college kids.
