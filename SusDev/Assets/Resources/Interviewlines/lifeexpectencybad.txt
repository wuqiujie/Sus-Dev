I hope our government can address the issues in public healthcare. Everyone in Shapetopia knows our public hospitals are a joke.
My dad has been ill for like 2 weeks. But heâ€™s still on the waiting list of our public hospital system.
I genuinely wish our public medical insurance could actually help us rather than providing us with a bunch of useless tablets.
I really wish there could be some public area like a park or a basketball court in our neighborhood.
